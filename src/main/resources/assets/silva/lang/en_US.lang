# -- A Message from Nublia
silva.entry.nubliaMessage=A Message From Nublia
silva.page.nubliaMessage0=
silva.page.nubliaMessage1=Greetings. I am Nublia, Senior Researcher of the World Tree Institute of Higher Alfheim. I must say, your actions provoked quite a magical reaction - an active portal was infused with the power of the Ginnungagap. There was quite a lot of debate on the best way to respond to your actions.
silva.page.nubliaMessage2=Some argued for permanently sealing you from Alfheim, and others even attempting to kill you to prevent any further risk. As you can probably tell, neither of those options were selected. I advocated for giving you aid and teaching caution, and naturally wound up in the position of your sponsor.
silva.page.nubliaMessage3=I have included notes on both portal creation and the various realms of the world tree.

# -- WORLD TREE INTRO
silva.entry.worldTreeIntro=Introduction to the World Tree
silva.page.worldTreeIntro0=The &4World Tree&0 is the great tree which holds our worlds together. From its branches come the nine realms: &4Asgard&0, &4Alfheim&0 (our realm), &4Midgard&0 (your realm), &4Jotunheim&0, &4Svartalfheim&0, &4Muspelheim&0, &4Niflheim&0, &4Nidavellir&0, and &4Vanaheim&0.
silva.page.worldTreeIntro1=Some realms contain locations of great enough significance to have their own &4dimensional signature&0.
silva.page.worldTreeIntro2=The &4World Tree&0 is surrounded by the great &4Ginnungagap&0 - a powerful void of great and terrible energies, and the origin of the &4phenomena&0 witnessed during your...incident.

# -- ADVANCED PORTALS
silva.entry.advancedPortals=Advanced Portals
silva.page.advancedPortals0=Since Thor shattered the original bridge, we have had an increasing dependence on smaller, weaker portals akin to the one you initially created. While they do not, at least by methods known to us, permit the travel of living beings, they have facilitated a partial reconstruction of the &4trade network&0 between realms. While the portal you created out of wood and metal is impressive for such an
silva.page.advancedPortals1=ad-hoc creation, portals constructed from &4Bifrost&0 are far more refined, adaptable, and efficient. Said portal can be tuned to connect to any of the nine realms, and any locations within with their own signature. The portal not only permits trade, but also lets some of each realm's underlying magical essence leak through, manifesting as specific effects in the portal's vicinity.
silva.page.advancedPortals2=The full requirements for the portal are as follows: 8 &1Bifrost Blocks&0, 4 &1Bifrost Stairs&0, 3 &1Sparkling Bifrost Blocks&0, a &1Portal Core&0 (read on), and 2 &1Portal Pylons&0 (read on), as well as a &4dimensional signature&0 (read on).
silva.page.advancedPortals3=A &4dimensional signature&0 tunes the portal to its target location, usually a realm, but occasionally a location within. A signature is drawn in front of the portal, normally with &1pixie dust&0 in &4Alfheim&0, though any dust with some magical nature should suffice. Each signature has a specific shape, all of them occupying a 5 by 3 space. I have included the signatures known to us in these papers.
silva.page.advancedPortals4=Crafting the &1Portal Core&0
silva.page.advancedPortals5=Crafting the &1Portal Pylons&0
silva.page.advancedPortals6=Advanced Portal
silva.page.advancedPortals7=Creating a &4dimensional signature&0
silva.page.advancedPortals8=This portal requires a fair bit more &4Mana&0 to open than the wooden one, but once opened it has a fraction of the continuous drain. In addition, the portal allows for stronger dilation of time, accelerating &4bulk trades&0.

# -- BIFROST
silva.entry.bifrost=The Bifrost
silva.page.bifrost0='&4Bifrost&0' refers both to the now-shattered rainbow bridge of &4Asgard&0 and that bridge's material. Said material was the only known thing to have the properties required for such a bridge. Unfortunately, the amount of it that would be required to rebuild the bridge has exceeded the existing supply by several orders of magnitude.
silva.page.bifrost1=Regardless, what of it we do have is useful for a few different tasks. For starters, while individual blocks of &4Bifrost&0 are weak, it becomes stronger when adjacent to others, eventually being rendered almost indestructible. Thor's abilities permitted him to shatter it in one blow, but short of such power, destroying a block surrounded by four others is impossible.
silva.page.bifrost2=A more common use ever since the &4Shattering&0, however, is to harness its interworldly nature for the creation of portals between the realms. Such a portal is described under 'Advanced Portals'.
silva.page.bifrost3=There are three ways known to us to create the material, one of which is useless for portal creation, the second of which demands a lot of &4Mana&0, and the third of which requires an existing supply.
silva.page.bifrost4=The first method summons the blocks purely from &4Mana&0, resulting in a quickly vanishing &1psuedo-Bifrost&0. Such a material, though reportedly a crucial portion of the bridge, has little use in feasible quantities, though you seem to have harnessed it to create something useful for temporarily bridging gaps.
silva.page.bifrost5=The second method uses similar techniques, but instead channels the &4Mana&0 into a &1Block of Dragonstone&0, using the stability of the &4Dragonstone&0 to create 18 &1Shards of Bifrost&0, which are more permanent. These shards can then be put together to form a full block of normal, permanent &4Bifrost&0. Since you don't have any existing supply, you will need to make at least one batch with this method.
silva.page.bifrost6=The third method uses an interesting property of the permanent &1Bifrost Blocks&0: when in contact with a &1Block of Dragonstone&0, they will convert it, resulting in a second &1Bifrost Block&0 and nine &1Shards of Bifrost&0 without using any additional &4Mana&0.
silva.page.bifrost7=Crafting a &1Bifrost Block&0
silva.page.bifrost8=Turning the block back into &1Bifrost Shards&0

# -- Alfheim
silva.entry.dimAlfheim=Alfheim
silva.page.dimAlfheim0=&4Alfheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and is inhabited by us &4Elves&0. Before the &4Shattering&0 we had grand cities constructed in the most massive of trees, and have been rebuilding our previous grandeur ever since. We are skilled at magic and craftmanship, and are the only ones with the secret of growing the elusive &1Dreamwood&0. It is a beautiful realm of nature and magic that I wish you could visit.
silva.page.dimAlfheim1=Exposure to &4Alfheim&0's energies results in a slight increase in grace and speed, our realm's little gift to you.

# -- Asgard
silva.entry.dimAsgard=Asgard
silva.page.dimAsgard0=&4Asgard&0 is one of the nine realms, and is inhabited by the &4Asgardians&0. It was previously a place of grand spires and trade. It was home to the &4Bifrost&0 before the &4Shattering&0, making it a nexus of culture and industry. Since the &4Shattering&0, we have had little contact despite our best efforts.
silva.page.dimAsgard1=From what we have gathered there is some force there which still threatens the &4Asgardians&0, though they are almost completely unwilling to share any further information. Whether or not this is simply the legendary &4Asgardian pride&0 is unknown.
silva.page.dimAsgard2=Exposure to &4Asgard&0's energies results in a slight increase in strength and toughness, though nothing like a native &4Asgardian&0.

# -- Ginnungagap
silva.entry.dimGinnungagap=Ginnungagap
silva.page.dimGinnungagap0=&4Ginnungagap&0 is the energized void outside of the &4World Tree&0. It is massive, seemingly without limit. Unlike the nine realms, we know of multiple signatures associated with it, however a powerful being of massive dimensional energies which resides within it prevents us from opening a portal there.
silva.page.dimGinnungagap1=We can only speculate as to how one could reach the &4Ginnungagap&0-we have records of some sort of creature in &4Midgard&0 with a connection to it, and before the &4Shattering&0, your kind had some sort of link to it, but little else is known. No method known to our kind can create a portal to it.
silva.page.dimGinnungagap2=What exposure to the &4Ginnungagap&0's energies would do is unknown due to our inability to open a portal to it.

# -- Helheim
silva.entry.dimHelheim=Helheim
silva.page.dimHelheim0=&4Helheim&0 is a hall on the edge of &4Niflheim&0. It is ruled over by Hel and is where those who die of sickness are taken. Since the &4Shattering&0 we can sense that the dead are on the other side, but neither they nor Hel reply to any message we send through.
silva.page.dimHelheim1=Exposure to &4Helheim&0's energies results in weakness to mortals and instant deanimation to necrotic beings.

# -- Jotunheim
silva.entry.dimJotunheimr=Jotunheim
silva.page.dimJotunheimr0=&4Jotunheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and is inhabited by the &4Giants&0. Most of the &4Giants&0 died during the &4Shattering&0 as holes opened in &4Jotunheim&0, though they have recovered somewhat. They are mostly lacking in the way of civilization, and we have found little use for portals to their realm.
silva.page.dimJotunheimr1=Exposure to &4Jotunheim&0's energies results in gaining the power of a giant at the cost of the slowness of a giant. We find the trade inconvenient, but you may like it.

# -- Midgard
silva.entry.dimMidgard=Midgard
silva.page.dimMidgard0=&4Midgard&0 is one of the nine realms, and is the one in which you live. You probably know more about it than we do. For obvious reasons, you cannot open a portal to it.
silva.page.dimMidgard1=Exposure to &4Midgard&0's energies results in trees growing at an extraordinarily rapid rate into incredibly small trees by our standards, though you would find such things normal. In our world, trees take years to centuries to grow and can easily be big enough for us to form houses in.

# -- Muspelheim
silva.entry.dimMuspelheim=Muspelheim
silva.page.dimMuspelheim0=&4Muspelheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and was one of the original two realms which resulted in the world tree. It was inhabited by the &4Fire Giants&0 until the &4Shattering&0, during which it crashed into &4Midgard&0. Since then, we haven't found any evidence of sentient life within. However, your book makes references to a place of fire and heat, one you have traversable links to.
silva.page.dimMuspelheim1=Exposure to &4Muspelheim&0's energies results in fire and charring. We occasionally use it as a furnace, and you can probably do the same by using a &4Bifrost portal&0.

# -- Nidavellir
silva.entry.dimNidavellir=Nidavellir
silva.page.dimNidavellir0=&4Nidavellir&0 is one of the nine realms, and is home to the &4Dwarves&0. They live underground and are expert miners and smiths. Their resistance helped them recover quickly from the &4Shattering&0, and while they haven't rebuilt all of their tunnel networks, the individual tribes are faring quite well in both life and trade.
silva.page.dimNidavellir1=Exposure to &4Nidavellir&0's energies results in increased mining finesse, and in the case of longer exposure, enhanced night vision.

# -- Niflheim
silva.entry.dimNiflheim=Niflheim
silva.page.dimNiflheim0=&4Niflheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and was one of the original two realms responsible for the creation of the world tree. It was almost completely uninhabited, save for Helheim on its edge. During the &4Shattering&0 nothing much seemed to happen to it, especially due to its lack of inhabitants.
silva.page.dimNiflheim1=Exposure to &4Niflheim&0's energies will freeze and weaken things.

# -- Svartalfheim
silva.entry.dimSvartalfheim=Svartalfheim
silva.page.dimSvartalfheim0=&4Svartalfheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and is home to the &4Dark Elves&0. &nDo not open a portal to it&r. The &4Dark Elves&0 are cowardly and evil creatures, and while most lack almost any intelligence, a few of them possess extraordinary cunning and teach the others to act on their behalf.
silva.page.dimSvartalfheim1=&4Dark Elves&0 are the only creatures which know the secret of how to use &4Bifrost portals&0 to travel between realms, making opening a portal there extremely dangerous.
silva.page.dimSvartalfheim2=Teasing out what results from the &4Dark Elves&0' actions and the essence of &4Svartalfheim&0 would be tricky, and is a risk we &4Elves&0 have not been willing to take.

# -- Valhalla
silva.entry.dimValhalla=Valhalla
silva.page.dimValhalla0=&4Valhalla&0 is a hall within &4Asgard&0 where Odin takes half of those who are slain in combat. Since the &4Shattering&0, Odin has not been seen in it according to reports, though Thor has occasionally feasted there. However, he is reported to have an atypically small appetite, eating only a dozen times as much as the others.
silva.page.dimValhalla1=Exposure to &4Valhalla&0's energies results in strength in battle and powerful strikes.

# -- Vanaheimr
silva.entry.dimVanaheimr=Vanaheim
silva.page.dimVanaheimr0=&4Vanaheim&0 is one of the nine realms, and is home to the &4Vanir&0-powerful beings of wisdom and forsight. Even when the &4Bifrost&0 existed, gaining permission to visit &4Vanaheim&0 was difficult, and permission to form a lasting link outside of &4Folkvang&0 unheard of. As a result, I do not know its dimensional signature nor details of its energies.
silva.page.dimVanaheimr1=What exposure to &4Vanaheim&0's energies would do is unknown to us due to the secrecy of its signature.

# -- Folkvangr
silva.entry.dimFolkvangr=Folkvang
silva.page.dimFolkvangr0=&4Folkvang&0 is the accessable portion of &4Vanaheim&0, though how to get from it to &4Vanaheim&0 is a closely guarded secret. It is ruled over by Freyja of the &4Vanir&0 and holds half of those slain in battle. A portal to it leads to the hall &4Sessrumnir&0. Before the &4Shattering&0, one could use such a portal to call on the wisdom of Freyja, though she has not been seen since.
silva.page.dimFolkvangr1=Exposure to &4Folkvangr&0's energies results in calmness in battle, permitting one's strikes to fall on ones foes with the precision that those in &4Sessrumnir&0 possess.

# -- Vigridr
silva.entry.dimVigridr=Vigrid
silva.page.dimVigridr0=&4Vigrid&0 is the great field where the battle &4Ragnarok&0 is foretold to occur. Even now the ground there is filled with the energy of battle cries and death. No one lives there, but strange things sometimes occur on it, echoes of the future.
silva.page.dimVigridr1=Exposure to &4Vigrid&0's energies results in strange happenings in battle as the power of the future battle stretches backwards to touch the present. Exposed mice have slain men, men giants, and Asgardians  armies, all without any apparent difficulty. Exposed warriors have also forgotten their skills, dropped their weapons, and surrendered to their enemies.

# - DWARVEN TRADE
# -- DWARF INTRO
silva.entry.dwarfIntro=Dwarven Trade
silva.page.dwarfIntro0=Greetings and Good Mining from Nidavellir! It is wonderful to have new trading partners! We hope that we can build a great relationship with our skills. We have many things to offer, which are detailed in the attached pages. To start it would be a good idea to set up a system for indicating our &4nonbasic trade&0 offers.
silva.page.dwarfIntro1=For this, we dwarves use &1Trade Signs&0, which use a bit of &4Bifrost&0 and the energies of a portal to synchronize themselves with a corresponding sign on the other side. You should be able to make some of your own with &1Deeprock&0, one of the materials we offer as a &4basic trade&0.
silva.page.dwarfIntro2=Crafting &1Dwarven Trade Signs&0
silva.page.dwarfIntro3=The rest of the trades will show up on the signs, what we want on the left, and what we will give on the right. Simply press a sign like a button and the trade will be selected, which is indicated on each end's sign. Then, if you send your half through, we will reply with ours.
silva.page.dwarfIntro4=Deals are offered on a dwarf by dwarf basis, and they are free to change their deals at any time, though it is considered rude to change down a selected deal, so that of course isn't done.
silva.page.dwarfIntro5=As you build up a &4reputation&0 as a trading partner, you will find that we will be willing to offer more advanced trades. Participating in trades that require a greater level of skill will also boost your &4reputation&0 more than simply trading basic resources and trinkets ever could.
silva.page.dwarfIntro6=A final word of warning: While the &4Elves&0 centralize their portals, our portals are dispersed between the different tribes of dwarves. While simply closing and reopening the portal will still have it lead to the same portal on our side, if you were to disrupt the portal core itself it would be unlikely to reopen to our tribe, and you would have to develop a &4reputation&0 with whatever new tribe you connect to.

# -- BASIC DWARVEN RESOURCES
silva.entry.basicDwarvenResources=The Resources of Nidavellir
silva.page.basicDwarvenResources0=There are some exchanges we are willing to make at any time, as long as no trade is selected. These &4basic trades&0 will form a firm foundation for future &4nonbasic trades&0.
silva.page.basicDwarvenResources1=Trading for &1Deepweed&0
silva.page.basicDwarvenResources2=Trading for &1Deeprock&0
silva.page.basicDwarvenResources3=Trading for &1Shimmering Mushrooms&0

# -- BOOM MOSS
silva.entry.boomMoss=Boom Moss
silva.page.boomMoss0=&1Boom Moss&0 is a wonderful creation, and a staple of dwarven mining. Simply place down a patch of it and apply &4Mana&0 and it will grow at an incredible speed! Then, use a light tap to detonate it, causing a chain reaction to mine out large areas, though just the surface.
silva.page.boomMoss1=We often use it for prospecting to reveal entire new layers at a time before selecting where to dig, or letting it grow between things to expand large areas in a single blow.
silva.page.boomMoss2=Crafting &1Boom Moss&0
silva.page.boomMoss3=In addition to regular &1Boom Moss&0, some dwarves know the secret of enchanting it, creating something known as &1Master Boom Moss&0. It requires no additional &4Mana&0 beyond that of regular &1Boom Moss&0, but when detonated it carves out the stone with &4silken precision&0, letting miners handle all minerals in their original form.
silva.page.boomMoss4=Even better, it moves all the blocks thus mined back to the origin of the detonation, allowing the user to pick everything up with ease!
silva.page.boomMoss5=Trading for &1Master Boom Moss&0 (nonbasic trade)
silva.page.boomMoss6=&1Boom Moss&0 can be disrupted by higher heat levels such as those created in a &1Furnace&0. When dried out it will still explode, but will turn the things in its explosion to dust in the wind. Perhaps you could find a use for this variety.
silva.page.boomMoss7=Drying &1Boom Moss&0

# -- DWARF FORGING
silva.entry.dwarfForged=Dwarf-Forged!
silva.page.dwarfForged0=The &4Elves&0' skills at enchanting are well known, and a dwarf who goes into battle will be as covered in enchantments and runes as any elf. Nonetheless, at the core of any dwarf's weapon and tools, below the layers of enchantment and runes, lies the precise skill of a dwarven forgemaster.
silva.page.dwarfForged1=Such creations are superior in a multitude of both tiny and not-so-tiny ways, adding up to a steady and reliable base. While these advantages are not on the level of actual magic, &4dwarf-forged tools&0 are of course completely compatible with enchanting.
silva.page.dwarfForged2=A &4dwarf-forged sword&0's edge has tiny serrations which cause its hits to occasionally tear skin for a slight boost in damage, and its sharpness means that when it hits just right it can do absolutely massive damage!
silva.page.dwarfForged3=&4Dwarf-forged armor&0 has carefully-created interlocking pieces which will sometimes completely nullify even the most powerful blows!
silva.page.dwarfForged4=In addition, our smiths put careful grooves into their creations permitting things like &1Timeless Ivy&0 to mesh better, allowing it to repair at a faster rate and for less &1Mana&0.
silva.page.dwarfForged5=Any armor, tool, or weapon you get from us will be of dwarven make, and many of our smiths may be willing to craft equipment for you should you provide the materials and a fee. Such is their skill that they usually require less material than ordinary crafters, wasting less and making each ingot go further.
silva.page.dwarfForged6=Paying dwarven smiths to craft (nonbasic trade)
silva.page.dwarfForged7=Should you have objects not of dwarven make, not all hope is lost! While &4reforging&0 existing armor to our exacting standards is beyond the capability of most of our smiths, it is still possible to reforge the majority of equipment, even that of materials foreign to our world.

silva.entry.dwarvenBarrierStone=Dwarven Barrier Stones
silva.page.dwarvenBarrierStone0=&1Dwarven Barrier Stones&0 are a clever creation of us &4Dwarves&0. By infusing &1Deeprock&0 with a &1Mana Pearl&0 and inscribing it with certain runes, &4Dwarves&0 can create a stone which, upon impact with a surface, expands in two directions, forming a barrier.
silva.page.dwarvenBarrierStone1=It is useful for rapidly blocking up tunnels when necessary, or quickly creating bridges across pits. In addition, the high density of the stone within puts a nasty bruise on any foe it hits.

# -- DWARVEN CHAIN
silva.entry.dwarvenChain=Dwarven Chain
silva.page.dwarvenChain0=The great chain Gleipnir was crafted by our kind to bind the mighty wolf Fenrir, and is the only object known to be able to. Crafted from the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish, and the spittle of a bird it was a magnificent thing. But who has the time to get all that?
silva.page.dwarvenChain1=Nonetheless, the same techniques can be used with more typical materials to craft a mighty, if not completely unstoppable, chain which can be used to bind other creatures even if they resist. A &1Dwarven Chain&0 functions much like a rope &1Lead&0, but it can be used on creatures more aggressive than your typical pet or livestock.
silva.page.dwarvenChain2=Trading for a &1Dwarven Chain&0 (nonbasic trade)

# -- DWARVEN MANA POOL
silva.entry.dwarvenManaPool=Dwarven Mana Pools
silva.page.dwarvenManaPool0=We &4Dwarves&0 have ready access to different materials than those common to Midgard and Alfheim, and our methods of manipulating &1Mana&0 are therefore quite different. While races that dwell on the surface of their realm typically use some sort of wooden spreader, in conjunction with pools made of &1Livingrock&0. In &4Nidavellir&0, we tend to rely instead on pools made of &1Deeprock&0 and &1Mana Crystals&0. Our pools lack the ability to disperse power automatically to nearby devices, but have can store &4Mana&0 more densely than those made of &1Livingrock&0.
silva.page.dwarvenManaPool1=They are still fully capable of infusing items and connecting to &1Mana Spreaders&0 or &1Sparks&0, flowers and mushrooms are the only sort of thing that our pools do not interact with. For more information about how we manipulate &4Mana&0, see the entry on &1Mana Crystals&0.
silva.page.dwarvenManaPool2=Crafting a &1Dwarven Mana Pool&0

# -- MEAD OF POETRY
silva.entry.dwarvenMead=Mead of Poetry
silva.page.dwarvenMead0=Ah, the &1Mead of Poetry&0! Truly a wonderous drink! Despite its questionable origins, who could resist such a beverage? Delicious, sweet, and strong enough to make an entire party of dwarves black out. To my knowledge, I myself have partaken in it a total of thirty-one times in my life, though despite this I can only recall two times I've witnessed someone drunk on it.
silva.page.dwarvenMead1=One occasion was in a tavern, and the dwarf in question has recently achieved some accomplishment or another-the details escape me, I was rather well supplied at the time. After a single mug he was singing a wonderful song, knocked over three tables, then bit off his companion's finger and used the bloody stump to write a poem on the wall of the tavern. Good times.
silva.page.dwarvenMead2=The other occasion was seeing it used in combat. The one who drank it was shouting strange facts and swinging his sword every which way, a full half his strikes going completely wild as he jumped around like a madman. Come to think of it, the singing dwarf was jumping as well... The strikes that did hit, though, were perfectly aimed and devastating in strength. He won with ease and immediately passed out.
silva.page.dwarvenMead3=Trading for &1Mead of Poetry&0 (nonbasic trade)

# -- MANA CRYSTAL
silva.entry.manaCrystal=Dwarven Mana Manipulation
silva.page.manaCrystal0=&1Mana Crystals&0 are the other half of the standard dwarven &4Mana&0 system. The elven system has nothing that it can be directly compared to, though it can serve the functions of a spreader, a tablet, or a pool.
silva.page.manaCrystal1=It has an internal storage of &4Mana&0 not quite as large as &1Mana Pools&0 or &1Mana Tablets&0, but considerably sized, enough to not be considered a buffer in spreaders. It automatically sends &4Mana Bursts&0 downwards, allowing for transport. It can be charged via &4Mana Bursts&0, &1Mana Pools&0, or &1Sparks&0 and keeps its internal &4Mana&0 storage when picked up. It can also supply and accept mana to and from flowers and mushrooms, like &1Livingrock&0 pools and &1Spreaders&0, respectively.
silva.page.manaCrystal2=Trading for &1Mana Crystals&0 (nonbasic trade)

# -- STONE HORSE
silva.entry.stoneHorse=Stone Horse
silva.page.stoneHorse0=A classic final challenge for an apprentice dwarven stonecarver is to carve a horse our of stone with such detail that it comes to life. As a result, we have quite the surplus and will trade them readily in exchange for the materials needed to carve another.
silva.page.stoneHorse1=Placing down the &1Stone Horse&0 will animate it, resulting in a horse that needs no saddle, and while it can be equipped with external armor, will have some natural armor of its own given its composition. Should the horse be sufficiently damaged, it will return to its statue state to be placed down again.
silva.page.stoneHorse2=Trading for a &1Stone Horse&0 (nonbasic trade)

# -- LAVACAP
silva.entry.lavaShroom=Lavacap
silva.page.lavaShroom0=The &1Lavacap&0 is us &4Dwarves&0' primary answer to &4Mana&0 generation. Consuming large amounts of both &4Lava&0 and solid fuel, but generating extreme amounts of &4Mana&0 in the process, these massive mushrooms provide most of our &4Mana&0. A &1Lavacap&0 generates more &4Mana&0 if the fuel is more potent, in relation to both fuel spent and time elapsed.
silva.page.lavaShroom1=Creating and activating a &1Lavacap&0 requires one &1giant red mushroom&0, a &1Red Shimmering Mushroom&0, a piece of &1Deeprock&0, some &4Lava&0, and several &1Runes&0.
silva.page.lavaShroom2=Lavacap
silva.page.lavaShroom3=Place &1Lava&0 in the hole in the top
silva.page.lavaShroom4=Throw the &1Runes&0 into the small pool on the top. These will not be returned if you break the structure later, as they are incorporated into the mushroom itself.
silva.page.lavaShroom5=The &1Lavacap&0 constantly loses some of its internal heat even when not in use, though when it is burning fuel it loses heat much faster. To feed it fuel simply burn the items in the &4enchanted lava&0 on the sides of the cap just as you would burn an item in normal &1Lava&0.
silva.page.lavaShroom6=As long as it has a good supply of &1Lava&0, the &4enchanted lava&0 flowing from the cap will pulse slightly. If it cools down, fuel will be burned without generating &4Mana&0 and the &4enchanted lava&0 will dull. The &4Mana&0 generated will automatically drain into &1Mana Pools&0 or &1Mana Crystals&0 touching the bottom of the stalk, where the &1Red Shimmering Mushroom&0 was during construction.

# - THE DARK ELVES

# -- ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM NUBLIA
silva.entry.darkElfIntro=Another Message from Nublia
silva.page.darkElfIntro0=
silva.page.darkElfIntro1=I wish to begin this message by apologizing for using your Mana. Intercepting your connection took a fair bit, and strictly speaking I'm not supposed to be doing this, so I used some of your Mana to camouflage my actions.
silva.page.darkElfIntro2=While I did warn you against opening this portal, I can't say I didn't see it coming. I'm neither Heimdall nor a Vanir, but I have learned some divination, and, no offense, you aren't exactly the most subtle or unpredictable.
silva.page.darkElfIntro3=I'm not going to chide you for your actions. While risky, I think that many of my kind have forgotten the importance of risks, especially since the Shattering. I have included my notes on Svartalfheim and its people in the rest of these pages. I recommend you begin with "On the Nature of Dark Elves", and I and wish you the best of luck in your research.

# -- ON THE NATURE OF DARK ELVES
silva.entry.darkElfDesc=On the Nature of Dark Elves
silva.page.darkElfDesc0=&4Dark Elves&0 are the pseudo-civilized inhabitants of &4Svartalfheim&0. They are, for the most part, a cowardly and foolish species, with a few problematic exceptions. They divide themselves into a variety of mostly arbitrary hierarchies.
silva.page.darkElfDesc1=While I shall not go into the detail of their convoluted and mostly nonsensical power games and hierarchies, there are two primary types of dark elves, which I will refer to as &4fools&0 and &4menaces&0. In general, the &4menaces&0 are higher up on their hierarchies, but the location tells little.
silva.page.darkElfDesc2=The &4fools&0 possess almost no foresight or real creativity, only malice and impulse. If it weren't for the &4menaces&0, they would be at most a pest, easy enough to deal with. However, while neither &4fools&0 nor &4menaces&0 have much patience for cooperation, they do somehow manage some small degree of it.
silva.page.darkElfDesc3=The most common method of 'cooperation' that occurs among the &4Dark Elves&0 is comparable to slavery, but the impulsiveness and lack of foresight by the &4fools&0 renders even enslaving them unreliable.
silva.page.darkElfDesc4=Such relationships are generally short-lived, due to either small-scale rebellion, often punished with death, or should the master also be a &4fool&0, the simple misplacement of the slave. Such relationships are usually harmless to the external world.
silva.page.darkElfDesc5=The second most common relationship is teaching. In an attempt to increase the fools' destructive capacity, a &4menace&0 may develop a simple '&4recipe&0' for a &4fool&0 to follow, distilling many hours of engineering and invention into a simple set of steps the &4fool&0 can apply, usually for &4sabotage&0.
silva.page.darkElfDesc6=It is this relationship that makes the &4fools&0 an actual threat. While they lack any sort of depth of understanding of what they do, the instructions they are given are well tuned to getting around such limits, permitting them acts of cleverness well beyond their intelligence.
silva.page.darkElfDesc7=However, due to their lack of understanding, such actions are fairly easy to manipulate - for example, leaving a portal open and unattended will often lure a &4fool&0 through for an act of &4sabotage&0, and their inability to actually understand the mechanisms means that one can harness the admittedly great engineering skills of the &4menaces&0.
silva.page.darkElfDesc8=An illustrative example of such a '&4recipe&0' is one of the most common, tampering with a &1Mana Spreader&0 so as to reverse it, making its &4Mana Bursts&0 drain &4Mana&0 from the target &1Mana Pool&0 into the one adjacent to the modified spreader, ruining any mechanism not made with such a behavior in mind.
silva.page.darkElfDesc9=However, due to &4fools&0' lack of understanding, they cannot determine if it is truly part of a vulnerable mechanism-simply placing a spreader near an unattended portal results in them converting it, and these new &1Mana Eaters&1 can be used, in a somewhat unorthodox manner, to transport mana at a greater rate than even a &1Gaia Spreader&0, and in some cases using fewer spreaders than typical methods would require.
silva.page.darkElfDesc10=The third relationship is the most dangerous, and fortunately incredibly rare: armies. Through some mechanism, a &4menace&0 may manage to recruit a vast number of &4fools&0 and lesser &4menaces&0 for an extended period of time, enabling them to form a somwehat coherent army. Such armies carry terrible and destructive weapons invented by the greater &4menaces&0.
silva.page.darkElfDesc11=No such army has been seen since the &4Shattering&0, which, given their knowledge on traversal of &4Bifrost portals&0, is incredibly fortunate. Should they form an army, they would be a devastating force against all the realms.

# -- CARNILOTUS
silva.entry.carnilotus=Carnilotus
silva.page.carnilotus0=Using the aggressive tendencies of the &1Mana Eaters&0, and mimicking certain carnivorous mundane plants at a larger scale, an eternally hungering flower can be created. The &1Carnilotus&0 consumes creatures in exchange for &4Mana&0, like the &1Gourmaryllis&0 but a bit...meaner.
silva.page.carnilotus1=The &1Carnilotus&0 prefers its food still-moving, and will simply dissolve any items dropped in. If a drop can be cooked, like most &4meat&0, it generates &4Mana&0 more efficiently than a &1Gourmaryllis&0 would. Items that can't be cooked, it generates mana at the standard rate. It's worth noting that while &4skeletal creatures&0 don't yield anything edible, the &1Carnilotus&0, being a plant, is nourished by &1Bones&0, and the plant-friendly nutrients in their marrow will act as a boost for a few future digestions.
silva.page.carnilotus2=Creating and activating the &1Carnilotus&0 requires 9 &1Mana Eaters&0, 36 &1Purple Petal Blocks&0, 9 &1Black Petal Blocks&0, 9 &1Iron Bars&0, 2 &1Livingwood&0, some &1Water&0, several &1Runes&0, and 32 &1Sugar&0.
silva.page.carnilotus3=Carnilotus
silva.page.carnilotus4=Fill the interior with water, 2 blocks deep.
silva.page.carnilotus5=From a safe distance, drop in the &1Runes&0 and &1Sugar&0.
&o...why does it have teeth?&r

# -- RHODODENDER
silva.entry.rhododender=Rhododender
silva.page.rhododender0=The &1Rhododender&0 is simple enough in concept, it simply throws &1Ender Pearls&0 in a relaying fashion. Each time the pearl is thrown, however, the damage taken when it finally lands increases, so be careful. This flower, unlike the &1Spectranthemum&0, is not governed by the &4axiom of chunkloading&0, and will temporarily load chunks as necessary.
silva.page.rhododender1=How it throws the &1Ender Pearl&0 can be controlled by placing dusts around it-each dust in a given cardinal direction increases strength, both in that direction and upwards. Dusts on opposite sides counter each other laterally, but each one still contributes to vertical strength.
silva.page.rhododender2=&oPlay ball!&r

# -- PLACEABLE DUST
silva.entry.placeableDust=Placeable Dust
silva.page.placeableDust0=While not necessarily as useful as &1Redstone&0, the world contains a variety of similar materials-&1Glowstone&0 forms a dust when not in blocks, a &1Blaze Rod&0 can be ground into a fine powder, and even the magical pixies of &4Alfheim&0 leave behind a useful dust. Naturally, all of these can be smeared on the ground like &1Redstone&0, though you aren't sure how useful each would be.

# -- PORTAL UPGRADES
silva.entry.portalUpgrades=Portal Upgrades
silva.page.portalUpgrades0=Your &4Bifrost portal&0, while well and good, has room for improvement. Fortunately, it has a modular design permitting you to upgrade it easily. Any of the &1Sparkling Bifrost Blocks&0 which make it up can be replaced with an upgrade for various effects.
silva.page.portalUpgrades1=A simple upgrade will permit you to easily control it via &1Redstone&0-an active signal opening the portal, and its absence closing it. Of course, opening the portal will still cost a lot of &4Mana&0, but this control can still be useful for long-term closures.
silva.page.portalUpgrades2=Crafting a &1Redstone Control Portal Upgrade&0
silva.page.portalUpgrades3=The &4energies&0 which leak through the portal are often useful, but in some cases you don't want snow to pile up or things to light on fire. A simple enough upgrade will inhibit most energies passing through the portal while still permitting trade.
silva.page.portalUpgrades4=Crafting an &1Inhibitor Portal Upgrade&0
silva.page.portalUpgrades5=If you do want the &4exposure energies&0 to affect you, sitting and waiting in front of it can be tedious. To make things easier you can create a &1Realm Stone&0 and charge it up with energies from the portal, and then simply discharge the stone into yourself at a later time. You could even put multiple energies in it.
silva.page.portalUpgrades6=Crafting an uncharged &1Realm Stone&0
silva.page.portalUpgrades7=Crafting a &1Charging Portal Upgrade&0

# -- DARK ELF RESOURCES
silva.entry.darkElfResources=Dark Elf Resources
silva.page.darkElfResources0=A common form of &4Dark Elf sabotage&0 is converting simple blocks like stone and wood into a &4darkened form&0. These &1darkened blocks&0 are fairly easy to break normally, but crumble to dust unless a &4silk touch tool&0 is used. They are, however, enchanted so as to harden dramatically when struck with a tool, making retrieval much more tedious than removal.
silva.page.darkElfResources1=By design, the &4darkened blocks&0 are basically useless, however, attempting to purify them results in blocks of a rather paradoxical nature, which have interesting magical properties due to the conflicting magical energies within them.
silva.page.darkElfResources2=Darkening &1Stone&0
silva.page.darkElfResources3=Darkening &1Wood&0

# -- MOVING ENCHANTMENTS
silva.entry.movingEnchantments=Moving Enchantments
silva.page.movingEnchantments0=While you can create armor and tools from &1paradox blocks&0, the conflicting energies within render them slightly unpleasant to the touch and no more effective than bare hands, making them worthless for any direct use. However, the same magical energies do cause them to have interesting properties with enchanting.
silva.page.movingEnchantments1=Though not directly enchantable, &1paradox items&0 can be made to leach &4enchantments&0 from mundane items, and subsequently yield them to a &1Book&0.
silva.page.movingEnchantments2=To do so requires an &1Enchantment Redistribution Plate&0 on top of a checkerboard pattern of &1Paradox Rock&0 and &1Patterened Framed Paradox Wood&0. Also, each transfer requires an &1Enchantment Allocation Catalyst&0, plenty of &4Mana&0, and of course the two items being used for the transfer.
silva.page.movingEnchantments3=Creating an &1Enchantment Redistribution Plate&0
silva.page.movingEnchantments4=Creating an &1Enchantment Allocation Catalyst&0
silva.page.movingEnchantments5=Creating a &1paradox item&0
silva.page.movingEnchantments6=After the plate is set up and ready to receive &4Mana&0, toss the required items on top of it and it will begin the transfer, consuming the original item and the catalyst.
silva.page.movingEnchantments7=Transfering &4enchantments&0 (&1Paradox Wood&0 is under the plate)
silva.page.movingEnchantments8=After the transfer, the paradox item will require additional power to loosen its newly-gained bonds with the &4enchantments&0. This power can be gained by killing creatures while having the item in your inventory, and will gain power in proportion to the &4XP&0 dropped. Once it is full, simply craft the item with a &1Book&0.
silva.page.movingEnchantments9=The entire process is rather expensive, and transferring multiple &4enchantments&0 in one process will be cheaper in terms of &4Mana&0, &4XP&0, and consumed items.

# -- MUSHROOMS
silva.entry.mushrooms=Mushrooms
silva.page.mushrooms0=The way the &4Dwarves&0 work with &4Mana&0 has differences beyond a storage and manipulation. Instead of working with &4Flowers&0, the cave-dwelling &4Dwarves&0 tend to use &4Mushrooms&0. While the large-scale ones like the &1Lavacap&0 are generally not too different from giant &4Flowers&0, the smaller varieties have some rather interesting differences. The most important quality to note is that &4Mushrooms&0 are best used in numbers, with each individual mushroom being rather insignificant, reproducing and dying as the colony spreads. While they do consume some amount of &4Mana&0, the amount used by each &4Mushroom&0 is rather miniscule, and as long as there's a decent &4Mana&0 supply in the vicinity, it should suffice.

# -- BLAZEBLOOM
silva.entry.blazebloom=Blazebloom
silva.page.blazebloom0=Digging out large rooms underground is quite a chore, as is deciding exactly how to change this flower into something that uses &1Fiery Pylons&0. The &1Blazebloom&0 will take care of this task in exchange for some &1Blaze Powder&0 and a large, but reasonable, amount of &4Mana&0. Simply lay out the shape of the desired room with &1Blaze Powder&0, place the flower directly above the perimeter at just below the level of the desired ceiling, and activate it, and the &1Blazebloom&0 will clear out the room with a giant explosion, obliterating any natural blocks within the defined shape.

# -- OBLITERATORY HOLLOWER
silva.entry.hollower=Obliteratory Hollower
silva.page.hollower0=Digging out large rooms underground is quite a chore. The &4Obliteratory Hollower&0 will take care of this task in exchange for some &1Blaze Powder&0 and an extreme, but reasonable in context, amount of &4Mana&0. Simply <REPLACE ME WITH HOW TO DEFINE SHAPE>, and <REPLACE ME WITH HOW TO ACTIVATE>, and the defined shape will be cleared with a giant explosion, obliterating any natural blocks within the defined shape.

# -- INFUSED PYLONS
silva.entry.infusedPylons=Infused Pylons
silva.page.infusedPylons0=There are a few varieties of energy-filled &4Pylons&0 that can be obtained with just &4Mana&0 and minerals, and some more with access to the &4Elves&0' resources. However, the crystal structure has the potential for many more uses. Placing an &1Untuned Pylon&0 near an active &4Bifrost Portal&0 will result in some of the realm's leaking energy being absorbed by the crystal, resulting in a pylon infused with the energies of that realm.
silva.page.infusedPylons1=It is worth noting that exposure via &4Bifrost Portals&0 is only the most common way to infuse a pylon. Simply placing down a pylon in a realm will infuse it directly. However, materials from a given realm are already full of that realm's energy, and need a surge of magical power such as the one released when a higher-level &1Gaia Guardian&0 is defeated, to be further infused.
silva.page.infusedPylons2=Crafting an &1Untuned Pylon&0
silva.page.infusedPylons3=Infusing an &1Untuned Pylon&0

# -- MANA POTATO
silva.entry.manaPotato=Mana Potato
silva.page.manaPotato0=Sometimes, you find yourself needing &4Mana&0 somewhere, but no need for infrastructure to keep it supplied, and setting up &1Mana Pools&0 that will barely end up being used gets tedious. The single-use and extremely cheap &1Mana Potato&0 solves this problem. When created, a &1Mana Potato&0 is pre-filled with &4Mana&0, and can then be immediately placed to temporarily supply &4Mana&0 to any nearby blocks. However, &1Mana Potatoes&0 cannot be refilled by any means, be it &4Mana Bursts&0, &1Sparks&0, or &1Mana Tablets&0. When empty, all that's left behind is a hollowed-out potato, not even useful as food.

# -- MYSTICAL GRINDER
silva.entry.mysticalGrinder=Mystical Grinder
silva.page.mysticalGrinder0=&1Deepweed&0 is quite the tenacious plant. Having to grow underground, it's able to extract as much nutrition from its soil as possible. Planting it in this realm's relatively rich and soft soil permits the use of &1Deepweed&0's extraction capabilities for other purposes. The &4Mystical Grinder&0 will take any mineral ore and utilize the abilities of &1Deepweed&0 to extract every last bit of material from the rock, something that would otherwise require a fortune enchantment too powerful to be imbued on any known material.
silva.page.mysticalGrinder1=Mystical Grinder
silva.page.mysticalGrinder2=Any ores on the bottom layer moving towards the core will be picked up if possible and distributed to the &1Deepweed&0 plants above. If necessary, the ore will be divided into smaller pieces to equally distribute the work between the 14 plants. After processing is completed, the output will be deposited directly below the core.

# -- ENDER CATCHER
silva.entry.enderCatcher=Ender Catcher
silva.page.enderCatcher0=Chains of &1Rhododenders&0 are incredibly useful, but a limit on their length is quickly reached due to the accumulated damage, and keeping a supply of &1Ender Pearls&0 is a nuisance. Utilizing pylons infused with the same energies as the pearls, the &1Ender Catcher&0 solves both of these problems, catching any &1Ender Pearls&0 above it. This ends the teleportation at the center of the structure without damage, and retrieves the pearl, depositing it in the &1Hopper&0 used in the structure's creation.
silva.page.enderCatcher1=Ender Catcher

# -- STURDY SLINGSHOT
silva.entry.slingshot=Sturdy Slingshot
silva.page.slingshot0=A &1Dispenser&0 can automatically throw things, sure, but it can't do it with precision, lacks potential for long-range use, and doesn't work with &1Ender Pearls&0. The &1Sturdy Slingshot&0 is a much more specialized device, capable of doing all of those things, while giving up the internal buffer, the capacity for items that a &1Dispenser&0 just drops on the ground, and in favor of manual activation, &4Redstone&0 control.
silva.page.slingshot1=To use the &1Sturdy Slingshot&0, one must simply set a trajectory by binding the block to a target location with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, insert an item using a &1Hopper&0 or something similar, and right click the block.
silva.page.slingshot2=Crafting a &1Sturdy Slingshot&0
